About
=====

bgdestroyer was created by Sam Stoelinga to make background removal available
to anyone. It's available as open source, both the backend and frontend so
anyone can run their own background image removal service.

You can view the source for the backend and frontend here:
- [Backend: github.com/samos123/bgdestroyer](https://github.com/samos123/bgdestroyer)
- [Frontend: github.com/samos123/bgdestroyer-ui](https://github.com/samos123/bgdestroyer-ui)

Please consider supporting the project by becoming a paid user.
